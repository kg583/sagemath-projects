# KG's SageMath Projects

Here you will find all of the my SageMath code that is either worth sharing or has already been shared somewhere else. Mirrors of existing files have been left in their original forms and formats. In particular, files utilized for peer-reviewed research purposes will not be altered for posterity; additional notes or improvements are relegated to comments. Other directories contain active projects or code that is unrelated to research ventures.

Each directory contains a `README` describing its contents, which links to any mirrors and relevant publications. Despite varying file extensions, all code uploaded to this repository requires SageMath to be run. SageMath is a free, open-source Python wrapper and library for mathematical computation and research; download it for yourself [here](https://www.sagemath.org/) or run it in your browser [on a free cell server](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/).
