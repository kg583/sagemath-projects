# KG's SageMath Projects

Here you will find all of the my SageMath code that is either worth sharing or has already been shared somewhere else. Mirrors of existing files have been left in their original forms and formats. In particular, files found in the `published` directory have been utilized for peer-reviewed research purposes and will not be altered for posterity (even if some of the code could be massively improved since then). Other directories contain active projects or code that is unrelated to research ventures.

Each directory contains a `README` describing its contents, which links to any mirrors and relevant publications. Despite varying file extensions, all code uploaded to this repository requires SageMath to be run. SageMath is a free, open-source Python wrapper and library for mathematical computation and research; download it for yourself [here](https://www.sagemath.org/) or run it in your browser [on a free cell server](https://sagecell.sagemath.org/).
